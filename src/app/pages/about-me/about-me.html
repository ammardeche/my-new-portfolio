          I’m Ammar, a web developer from Algeria, currently living and studying Computer Science in
          Poland. A journey that began with simple web pages has turned into a clear vision:
          creating products that solve real problems. Technology isn’t just a career path — it’s a
          way to express creativity, intelligence, and purpose. Moving to Poland opened a new
          chapter: learning new technologies, improving as a developer, and continuously challenging
          limits. Mistakes became lessons, and every challenge turned into motivation to grow
          stronger — both technically and personally. Passion is the fuel behind the work:
          experimenting with ideas, building modern solutions, and always pushing skills forward.
          The mission is simple — transform hard work into real expertise and create digital
          experiences that bring value to people.
